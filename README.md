# MeTime
MeTime is a flask-built web application that generates a timetable for the user using a self-made sorting algorithm that requires a few inputs. 

Below is the link to the documentation I wrote out for my client when making the project. It demonstrates my thought process and the vast amount of research and programming I did as I spent months working on this project
